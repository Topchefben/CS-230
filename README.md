Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room had achieved significant success with its puzzle competition game on the Android platform as a mobile app game creator. To expand its reach and make    the game available on various devices and platforms, the client sought to develop a web-based version of its existing Android app.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In my report, I provided an extensive recommendation section that highlighted crucial aspects for the client to consider. These included the operating system (OS) of the host, memory and storage management solutions on host servers, the API framework, security, and the advantages of utilizing serverless architecture to launch the product. I presented a compelling argument for why a cloud platform would be the most suitable option for the client's objective.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The UML class diagram, which illustrated the domain model, was helpful in comprehending the structure and interconnectivity of the app components' entities. This understanding enabled the development of succinct classes with clear methods that effectively utilized other entities to create a seamless prototype.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

To enhance the evaluation section that compares and contrasts various popular OSs (e.g., Mac, Windows, Linux) and mobile platforms, a more thorough examination of the differences between the platforms on the client side would be beneficial. The primary concern on the client-side is the web browser, which is the primary engine running the app for the client. Although research on the nuances between OSs for web-based solutions provided limited insight, a deeper analysis of OS preferences for specific browsers (e.g., Windows to Edge, Mac to Safari) could be conducted to determine whether non-preferred browsers introduce technical or performance limitations.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

When developing web-based apps, it's crucial to prioritize the user's key needs, such as speed and intuitiveness (i.e., usability). While quality characteristics, such as the app's appearance and feel, are also essential, they are less critical than speed and usability. A user may still use the app even if they don't like its appearance, but they will leave the site if the app's functionality is unclear or slow. The user's needs should be the topmost priority because they are the ultimate source of revenue for the client as the product's consumer.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The process of designing software involves starting with a broad understanding and gradually refining it to achieve precision. This approach involves taking high-level objectives and iterating through various stages to develop the final solution. For instance, a client's business objectives can be translated into functional requirements that outline the essential components needed to achieve those objectives. These functional requirements can then be further detailed into technical requirements, which describe the technical approach required to fulfill the functional requirements. The technical requirements can then be transformed into design documents, architecture, and code that fulfill those requirements and deliver the final solution.
